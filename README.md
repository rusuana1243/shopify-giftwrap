Create a gift-wrap product
First, you will create your gift-wrap option as a product:

From your Shopify admin, go to Products.

Click Add product.

Create a gift-wrap product just as you would create any other product:

You can use your product description to explain what materials will be used to gift-wrap the items.
Give your gift-wrap product the price that you want to charge for the service. If you want gift wrapping to be free, then set the price of your gift-wrap product to be 0.
You can upload an image for the product to show your customers what a gift-wrapped order will look like.
Make sure your gift-wrap product includes inventory, or else adjust the settings so that Shopify doesn't track inventory for the gift-wrap product. If your store has multiple locations, then uncheck Track quantity to prevent Shopify from tracking inventory for the gift-wrap product.
Click Save.

Create a menu
Next, create a menu that points to your gift-wrap product:

From your Shopify admin, go to Online Store > Navigation.
Click Add menu.
Name your menu Gift wrapping, so that the handle that's assigned to the menu is gift-wrapping.
Add the gift-wrap product to the menu:
Click Add menu item, and then enter a Name for the link to the gift-wrap product.
In the Link field, select Products, and then select the gift-wrap product from the drop-down menu.
Click Add.
Click Save menu.

Create a code snippet

From your Shopify admin, go to Online Store > Themes.
Find the theme you want to edit, click the â€¦ button to open the actions menu, and then click Edit code.
In the Snippets directory, click Add a new snippet.
Name your snippet gift-wrapping and click Create snippet. Your snippet file will open in the code editor.
In this step, you will paste some code into your new gift-wrapping snippet file. The code you paste depends on how you want to charge your customers for the gift wrapping service:
